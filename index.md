## Welcome to my UX Design website!

I am a Sports Nutritionist turned UX Designer. I decided to change tracks because I realised that a career in Nutrition did not fulfill my need for creative expression. As a Designer, I believe in creating products that improve the life of users. I encourage mindful designs that will continue to be accessible to all users.
