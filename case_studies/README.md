Here you will find three selected case-studies to showcase my work as a UX designer.
Over here I will add an [embedded link](www.google.com) to Google.

## Selected Case Studies
* [Medi Track]{:.heading.flip-title} --- A Medication Reminder Tool
* [Upgrade]{:.heading.flip-title} --- You can skip this if you haven't used Hydejack before.
* [Config]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Once Jekyll is running you can start editing your config file.
