### Understanding The User : User Research
#### User Research Summary
My research began with a series of inquiries directed at a variety of people in order to have a better understanding of their issues and demands in booking a seat for a movie. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of individuals and their needs, as well as to put them at the center of my design process, and product. I gathered information through one-on-one interviews in order to learn more about the people and the issues they confront. I conducted an unmoderated user reasearch with 5 participants on remote basis.

#### Persona : Sydney
Problem Statement : Sydney is a busy fashion designer who need to make sure that she can easily book her favourite seat for a movie online at anytime because she loves
to watch movies but is super busy for 6 days a week and spends more than 9 hours daily at her boutique attending clients or designing new dresses.

### The Design
#### Paper Wireframes
Taking the time to draft iterations of each screen of the app on paper ensured that the elements that made it to digital wireframes would be well-suited to address user pain points.

#### Digital Wireframes
As the initial design phase continued, I made sure to base screen designs on feedback and findings from  the user research.

#### Low-Fidelity Prototypes
Using the completed set of digital wireframes, I created a low-fidelity prototype. The primary user flow I connected was short listing a vendor from ‘bride’s wear’ category, so the prototype could be used in a usability study. I also added other user flows like browsing the checklist, shortlist and ideas section.

#### Usability Study Findings
**Connect Online Portals :** If one can connect online in this app and groups can be made with friends and family to directly share wishlist within the app itself.

### Refining The Design
People wanted to be able to share the wishlist/shortlist/favourites list with their friends and family groups online. This feature was not there before but haven been added after usability study.

#### High-Fidelity Mockups and Prototypes
Using the completed set of low-fidelity prototypes, I created a high-fidelity mockup and prototype.

#### Going Forward
#### Takeaways
**Impact:** The feedback I have gotten from the final prototype is positive. My second usability study showed that the design of this app meets the user’s needs.

**One quote from peer feedback:** *“That’s a pretty good design and flow.”*
#### What I learned
In designing this project, I learned that user research plays an invaluable role in the UX process. Based on the influence of the user interviews, peer reviews and usability studies, I was able to iterate a comprehensive and inclusive design.
