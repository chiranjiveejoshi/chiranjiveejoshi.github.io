I undertook this project to help individuals who have a busy demanding schedule or are out of station or by some means are not able to spare times, to plan a dream wedding for themselves or their friends and family, without missing out on the current trends and fashion, and easy options to compare between different vendors online, through an app, since they do not have the time to personally visit all the shops, venues, vendors, etc.

> Project Duration: 8 weeks

### The Problem
Most of the individuals have a busy demanding schedule or are out of station or by some means are not able to spare time, to plan a dream wedding for themselves or their friends and family. I wanted to develop an app that is a one-stop-shop app which can help these individuals to plan the wedding without missing out on the current trends and fashion, and find easy options to compare between different vendors online through an app since they do not have the time to personally visit 
all the shops, venues, vendors, etc.

### The Goal
To figure out if the users are successfully able to plan their dream wedding without missing out on the current trends and fashion by allowing them to surf through, and easily compare between different venues and vendors, book/finalise the vendors and add tasks to checklists.

### Understanding The User : User research
#### User Research Summary
My research began with a series of inquiries directed at a variety of people in order to have a better understanding of their issues and demands in planning a wedding. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of individuals and their needs, as well as to put them at the center of my design process, and product. I gathered information through one-on-one interviews in order to learn more about the people and the issues they confront. I conducted an unmoderated user reasearch with 5 participants on remote basis.
