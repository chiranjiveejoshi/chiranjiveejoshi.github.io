This is a cross-platform tool that has been designed to help users keep track of their medication. It is targeted towards the elderly, and people with very busy schedules, as they tend to forget taking their prescribed medication at the right time.
> Project Duration: 6 weeks

## Project Overview
### The Problem
People often forget to take their medications at the correct time. That is especially true for senior citizens and people with extremely hectic llives.
### The Goal
The goal is to design a simple tool that can help improve a person's quality of life by keeping track of medications and remiinding the users at the appropriate time
### My Role
Lead UX Designer, UX Researcher
### Responsibilities
User Research, Competitive Audit, Ideation, Wireframing, Prototyping (Lo-Fi + Hi-Fi)
### Dedicated Mobile App

## Understanding the User
### User Research Summary
My research began with a series of inquiries directed at a variety of people in order to have a better understanding of their issues and demands in remembering their routines. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of individuals and their needs, as well as to put them at the center of my design process, and
product. I gathered information through one-on-one interviews in order to learn more about the people and the issues they confront.
### Personas
#### Persona 1: Michelle Stewart
> Problem statement: Michelle is an Investment banker who needs timely medication reminders because she forgets on busy work days.
#### Persona 2: Mark Jacobs
> Problem statement: Mark is a retired salesman who needs to keep track of various medicines because of his medical conditions.
### Competitive audit
My goal in this competitive audit was to identify my key competitors and review the products my competitors offer. I looked at their visual layout and navigation, what resources they offer and their accessibility features. I also assessed what the competitors did well and what are the areas of improvement that I can incorporate in my products.
### Ideation
I used a crazy 8s method of ideation to come up with design ideas that meet the goals of the users. My main aim was to design multiple ideas that gives ideas for users goals like setting up a new reminder, snoozing a reminder, selection of day, date and time for medicines, adding a medicine list and history,etc.
 
## Starting the Design
### Digital Wireframes
As the design continued, I made sure to base screen designs on the findings from the user rsearch.

### Low-fidelity prototypes
The links to low-fidelity prototypes that I have designed can be found below - 

* Mobile Verision ([Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/pjzeF8TDVa6MgfQDIuNWf1/Medicine-Reminder-App?node-id=48%3A719&scaling=scale-down&page-id=47%3A277&starting-point-node-id=48%3A719&show-proto-sidebar=1))
* Tablet Version ([Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/pjzeF8TDVa6MgfQDIuNWf1/Medicine-Reminder-App?node-id=99%3A873&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=99%3A2&starting-point-node-id=99%3A873))
* Desktop Version ([Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/pjzeF8TDVa6MgfQDIuNWf1/Medicine-Reminder-App?node-id=63%3A734&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=63%3A2&starting-point-node-id=63%3))

### Usability Study: Findings
These were the main findings that the usability study revealed

## Refining the design
### Mockups
Users were finding it difficult to select the date while setting erminders and hence preferred a full block calendar where dates and days are aligned to each other and easy to peruse.

Users wanted an option to snooze reminders so that it won't be misseed out until the medicne is finally taken. An option to delete the reminder was also added.

### High-fidelity prototypes

* Mobile Verision ([Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/pjzeF8TDVa6MgfQDIuNWf1/Medicine-Reminder-App?node-id=49%3A2174&scaling=scale-down&page-id=49%3A2172))
* Tablet Version ([Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/pjzeF8TDVa6MgfQDIuNWf1/Medicine-Reminder-App?node-id=105%3A2765&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=105%3A2764))
* Desktop Version ([Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/pjzeF8TDVa6MgfQDIuNWf1/Medicine-Reminder-App?node-id=74%3A2566&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=74%3A2565))

The final prototype features many of the same design elements and flow as the lo-fi prototype, but several more were added after the usability study.

### Accesibility considerations

## Responsive Design
### Sitemap
Sitemap is a diagram of a website or application, that shows how pages are prioritized, linked, and labeled. It helps to understand how to access any useful information quickly and easily. During the construction of this sitemap, the results of the user testing were implemented for easy user flow. I also limited the level of details to minimum to avoid confusion and complexity. The main goal was to make sure that each area has all the necessary information for a user to operate this product.

### Responsive Designs
The research and decisions I made when designing this project are all based on real users who gave me a lot of insights to implement the usability and functionality of the product to achieve itâ€™s ultimate goal of not missing to take a single medicine and to take it at the prescribed time.

## Going Forward
### Takeaways

### Next Steps

## Inline HTML elements

HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

- **To bold text**, use `**To bold text**`.
- *To italicize text*, use `*To italicize text*`.
- Abbreviations, like HTML should be defined like this `*[HTML]: HyperText Markup Language`.
- Citations, like <cite>&mdash; Mark otto</cite>, should use `<cite>`.
- ~~Deleted~~ text should use `~~deleted~~` and <ins>inserted</ins> text should use `<ins>`.
- Superscript <sup>text</sup> uses `<sup>` and subscript <sub>text</sub> uses `<sub>`.

Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.
