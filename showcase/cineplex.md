CinePlex is a Website where you can purchase Movie Tickets. It facilitates quick and efficient booking for you, your friends, and your family, making the process more enjoyable. You can also reserve seats in advance and make changes to your booking, such as ‘Canceling’ or ‘Rescheduling’.

> Project Duration: January 2023 to February 2023

## Project Overview
### My Role
Lead UX Designer, UX Researcher
### My Responsibilities
**User Research, Competitive Audit, Ideation, Wireframing, Prototyping (Lo-Fi + Hi-Fi)**
* To design a seat reservation flow for a movie 
* Ideate and design app and website screens
* Test designs
* Ensure that the designs are interactive and provide a good user flow, user journey and a user experience
* Conduct test and research
* Re-iterate on designs
### The Problem
Busy workers lack the time to book themselves or their friends and family, the tickets to the movies.
### The Goal
Streamline the process of booking tickets to save as much time and energy as possible and without any hustle!
### Tools Used

## Design Process
I followed the ‘Design Thinking Framework’ for this project. The Design Thinking Framework is a User-centered approach to ‘problem-solving’ that includes activities like Research, Prototyping and Testing to help understand who the ‘User’ is, what their problems are, and what the design should include.

## Understanding The User
### User Research 
* I initiated my research by posing a series of questions to diverse individuals to comprehend their challenges and requirements when reserving a movie seat. The objective of this investigation was twofold: to obtain a deeper comprehension of people and their necessities and to prioritize them in my design approach and final product.

* I gathered information through one-on-one interviews in order to learn more about the people and the issues they confront. 

* Through my research, I identified the user group as all individuals who don’t have time to personally visit movie theatres to book movie tickets or are busy and want to book tickets quickly without any hustle.

* I conducted an unmoderated user reasearch with 5 participants on remote basis.

### User Painpoints

### Persona
Based on my analysis from the research I carried out, I was able to identify two personas 
that represent a diverse group of users. Also, I was able to comprehend what their
frustrations are and what their needs might be.

### User Journey Map
I created a User Journey Map which is an illustration of what the user goes through to achieve their goals. It helped me understand user’s problems, experiences, moods and behaviour, while using a product.

## Sitemap
I created a Sitemap, which is a diagram of a website, that shows how pages are prioritized, linked, and labeled. It helps to understand how to access any useful information quickly and easily. During the construction of this sitemap, the results of the user testing were implemented for easy user flow. I also limited the level of details to minimum to avoid confusion and complexity. The main goal was to make sure that each area has all the necessary information for a user to operate this product.

## The Design

## Paper Wireframes
* I proceeded to sketch Wireframes. 
* I started with Paper Wireframes for the main interfaces that show a complete User Flow. The main goal in this stage was to create easy and quick iterations of the Design for a simple User Flow. 
* Taking the time to draft iterations of each screen of the app on paper ensured that the elements that made it to Digital Wireframes would be well-suited to address User Pain Points.
*

## Digital Wireframes
As the initial Design phase continued, I made sure to base Screen Designs on Feedback and Findings from the user research and created Digital Wireframes making sure all the app features are iterated.

## Low-Fidelity Prototypes
Using the completed set of Digital Wireframes, I created a ‘Low-Fidelity’ Prototype. The main user journey that I observed involved first selecting a movie, then choosing a seat, making a payment, and finally receiving a confirmation message for the ticket.

## Usability Study
After prototyping the Low-Fidelity Wireframes, I conducted ‘Usability Study’ where I asked users to perform certain tasks to know how the users interacted with my Design. The first study helped me guide the Designs froms ‘Wireframes’ to ‘Mockups’.

## Accessibiliy Considerations

## Takeaways
**Impact:** The final prototype has received positive feedback, and the usability study indicates that the app's design is capable of meeting the user's needs.

**One quote from peer feedback:** *“Looks good for a Hi-Fi! Keep up the good work.”*

**What I learned:** During the project's design process, I obtained valuable insights into the pivotal role that user research plays in UX. By meticulously analyzing the feedback obtained through user interviews, peer reviews, and usability studies, I could progressively develop a comprehensive and inclusive design.
