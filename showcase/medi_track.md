This is a Cross-platform Tool as a Responsive Website that has been designed to help users keep track of their medication. It is targeted towards the elderly and people with very busy schedules as they tend to forget taking their prescribed medication at the right time.

> Project Duration: February 2023 to March 2023

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
### My Role
Lead UX Designer, UX Researcher
### My Responsibilities
User Research, Interviews, Usability Studies, Ideation, Wireframing, Mockups, Prototyping (Lo-Fi + Hi-Fi) and Testing
### The Problem
People often forget to take their medications at the correct time. This is especially true for senior citizens and people with extremely hectic lives.
### The Goal
My goal is to design a simple tool that can help improve a person’s quality of life by keeping track of medications and reminding the users at the appropriate time.
### Tools Used

## DESIGN PROCESS
I followed the ‘Design Thinking Framework’ for this project. The Design Thinking Framework is a user-centered approach to problem-solving that includes activities like Research, Prototyping and Testing to help understand who the ‘User’ is, what their problems are, and what the design should include.

## UNDERSTANDING THE USER
### User Research
I initiated my research by posing a series of inquiries to a diverse group of individuals to gain a deeper comprehension of their challenges and requirements when it comes to remembering their daily routines. The objective of this study was to gain insights into the individuals and their needs, and to prioritize them throughout the product design process. I gathered information by conducting one-on-one interviews to obtain a better understanding of the people and the challenges they encounter.
### Personas
#### Persona 1: Michelle Stewart
> Problem statement: Michelle is an Investment banker who needs timely medication reminders because she forgets on busy work days.

#### Persona 2: Mark Jacobs
> Problem statement: Mark is a retired salesman who needs to keep track of various medicines because of his medical conditions.

## SITEMAP
I created a Sitemap which is a diagram of a Website, that shows how pages are prioritized, linked, and labeled. It helps to understand how to access any useful information quickly and easily. I limited the level of details to a minimum to avoid confusion and complexity. The main goal was to make sure that each area has all the necessary information for a user to operate this product.

## IDEATION
For the Ideation, I used ‘Crazy Eights’ Method. Crazy Eights is a great way to get ideas flowing for any design problem you need to solve. With Crazy Eights, you’ll sketch eight different designs, each with a new idea for solving the user’s problem. The best part? It only takes eight minutes!

During the initial design phase, I focused on developing Digital Wireframes based on user research feedback and findings. Specifically, I prioritized creating Wireframes for the mobile version of the website.

Additionally, I performed a usability study to identify any pain points that users may have experienced with my design. Based on the results, I iterated on the designs to address these issues.

## AFFINITY DIAGRAM
I created an Affinity Diagram, also known as a Cluster Map. It helped me organize information into groups of similar items, while analyzing qualitative data/observations.

## LOW-FIDELITY PROTOTYPES
Using the completed set of Digital Wireframes, I created a ‘Low-Fidelity’ Prototype. The main user flow I established involved selecting a date to add a new reminder and then receiving a confirmation prompt once the reminder was successfully set, so the Prototype could be used in an Usability Study.

## ACCESSIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS

## TAKEAWAYS
### Impact
Based on the feedback I received from the final prototype, it appears that the website's design is meeting the users' needs. The results of my second usability study were positive.

**One quote from the peer feedback:**
> "Beautiful Design and easy User Flow"

### What I learned
Through the process of designing this project, I gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of user research in the UX process. By incorporating insights from user interviews, peer reviews, and usability studies, I was able to iteratively develop a comprehensive and inclusive design.
