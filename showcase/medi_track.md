## Project Overview
### The Problem
People often forget to take their medications at the correct time. This is especially true for senior citizens and people with extremely hectic lives.
### The Goal
My goal is to design a simple tool that can help improve a person’s quality of life by keeping track of medications and reminding the users at the appropriate time.
### My Role
Lead UX Designer, UX Researcher
### Responsibilities
User Research, Interviews, Usability Studies, Ideation, Wireframing, Mockups, Prototyping (Lo-Fi + Hi-Fi) and Testing
### Tools Used

## Design Process
I followed the ‘Design Thinking Framework’ for this project. The Design Thinking Framework is a User-centered approach to problem-solving that includes activities like Research, Prototyping and Testing to help understand who the ‘User’ is, what their problems are, and what the design should include.

### Dedicated Mobile App

## Understanding the User
### User Research
I initiated my research by posing a series of inquiries to a diverse group of individuals to gain a deeper comprehension of their challenges and requirements when it comes to remembering their daily routines. The objective of this study was to gain insights into the individuals and their needs, and to prioritize them throughout the product design process. I gathered information by conducting one-on-one interviews to obtain a better understanding of the people and the challenges they encounter.
### Personas
#### Persona 1: Michelle Stewart
> Problem statement: Michelle is an Investment banker who needs timely medication reminders because she forgets on busy work days.

### Sitemap
I created a Sitemap which is a diagram of a Website, that shows how pages are prioritized, linked, and labeled. It helps to understand how to access any useful information quickly and easily. I limited the level of details to minimum to avoid confusion and complexity. The main goal was to make sure that each area has all the necessary information for a user to operate this product.

### Ideation
For the Ideation, I used ‘Crazy Eights’ Method. Crazy Eights is a great way to get ideas flowing for any design problem you need to solve. With Crazy Eights, you’ll sketch eight different designs, each with a new idea for solving the user’s problem. The best part? It only takes eight minutes!

![Persona2](../img_repo/MT.IMG.08.png){:width="700" height="350" loading="lazy"}

During the initial design phase, I focused on developing digital wireframes based on user research, feedback and findings. Specifically, I prioritized creating wireframes for the mobile version of the website.

Additionally, I performed a usability study to identify any pain points that users may have experienced with my design. Based on the results, I iterated on the designs to address these issues.

### Affinity Diagram 
I created a ‘User Journey Map’, which is an illustration of what the user goes through to achieve their goals. It helped me understand user’s problems, experiences, moods and behaviour, while using a product.

### Digital Wireframes

### Low-fidelity prototypes
Using the completed set of Digital Wireframes, I created a ‘Low-Fidelity’ Prototype. The main user flow I established involved selecting a date to add a new reminder and then receiving a confirmation prompt once the reminder was successfully set, so the Prototype could be used in an Usability Study.

### Usability Study: Parameters

### Usability Study: Findings
These were the main findings that the usability study revealed
![usability_findings](../img_repo/cs3_img12_usability_study_findings.png){:width="600" height="400" loading="lazy"}

## Refining the design
### Mockups
Users were finding it difficult to select the date while setting erminders and hence preferred a full block calendar where dates and days are aligned to each other and easy to peruse.
![mockup1](../img_repo/cs3_img13_mockup_before_after.png){:width="600" height="400" loading="lazy"}

Users wanted an option to snooze reminders so that it won't be misseed out until the medicne is finally taken. An option to delete the reminder was also added.

### High-fidelity prototypes
The links to low-fidelity prototypes that I have designed can be found below -

The final prototype features many of the same design elements and flow as the lo-fi prototype, but several more were added after the usability study.

### Accesibility considerations
![accessibility](../img_repo/cs3_img23_accesibility.PNG){:width="600" height="400" loading="lazy"}

## Responsive Design
### Sitemap
Sitemap is a diagram of a website or application, that shows how pages are prioritized, linked, and labeled. It helps to understand how to access any useful information quickly and easily. During the construction of this sitemap, the results of the user testing were implemented for easy user flow. I also limited the level of details to minimum to avoid confusion and complexity. The main goal was to make sure that each area has all the necessary information for a user to operate this product.
![sitemap](../img_repo/cs3_img21_sitemap.png){:width="600" height="400" loading="lazy"}


### Responsive Designs
The research and decisions I made when designing this project are all based on real users who gave me a lot of insights to implement the usability and functionality of the product to achieve it’s ultimate goal of not missing to take a single medicine and to take it at the prescribed time.

## Going Forward
### Takeaways
#### Impact
The feedback I have received from the final prototype is positive. My second usability study showed that the design of this app and it’s responsive website versions meets the user’s needs.

One quote from the peer feedback:
> "That's a pretty good and clear cut prototype"

#### What I learned
In designing this project, I learned that user research plays an invaluable role in the UX process. Based on the influence of the user interviews, peer reviews and
usability studies, I was able to iterate a comprehensive and inclusive design.
