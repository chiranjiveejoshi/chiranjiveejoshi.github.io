Wedding Mantra is a ‘One-Stop-Shop’ App, designed to assist people who are unable to allocate enough time to plan a dream wedding for themselves or their loved ones. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as having a very demanding schedule or living far away. Wedding Mantra can help accomplish hassle-free online experience of vendor comparison, enabling users to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and fashion without physically visiting various shops, venues, or vendors.

> Project Duration: November 2022 to January 2023

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
### My Role
Lead UX Designer, UX Researcher
### My Responsibilities as a UX Designer
**User Research, Competitive Audits, Ideation, Wireframing, Mockups and Prototyping (Lo-Fi + Hi-Fi):**
* To design a Ceremonial Checklist App for trendy wedding
* To conduct Interviews
* To conduct Usability Studies
* To Ideate and Design App Screens
* To Test the Designs
* To ensure that the Designs are Interactive and provide a good User Flow, User Journey and an User Experience
* To conduct Test and Research
* To re-iterate on Designs
### The Problem
Many people are unable to devote the necessary time and attention to plan a dream wedding, due to busy schedules, travel, or other commitments. Consequently, this leads to a lot of hassle, an inability to achieve an envisioned target  of having a dream wedding, and a lack of satisfaction.
### The Goal
The aim is to verify if users can effectively utilize the app's browsing features, shortlist vendors, finalize bookings, and add tasks to checklists to ensure everything is on track. By doing so, we can determine whether the app is helping users achieve their goal of having a dream wedding without missing out on current trends and fashion.
### Tools Used

## DESIGN PROCESS
I followed the ‘Design Thinking Framework’ for this project. The Design Thinking Framework is a User-centered approach to problem-solving that includes activities like Research, Prototyping and Testing to help understand who the ‘User’ is, what their problems are, and what the design should include.

### User Journey Map
I created a User Journey Map which is an illustration of what the user goes through to achieve their goals. It helped me understand user’s problems, experiences, moods and behaviour, while using a product.

### Story Boarding
I designed ‘Big Picture Storyboard’ and ‘Closeup Storyboard’ for one of my persona (Aarushi) to visually predict and understand her experience while using my app.

## COMPETITIVE AUDIT
I conducted a Competitive Analysis by comparing the different features and experience of browsing through different vendors of both, ‘Direct’ and ‘Indirect’ Competitors’ Apps with the aim of identifying whether the needs of users are met and common problems that I can solve with my app.

### The Design
#### Paper Wireframes
Taking the time to draft iterations of each screen of the app on paper ensured that the elements that made it to digital wireframes would be well-suited to address user pain points.

#### Digital Wireframes
As the initial design phase continued, I made sure to base screen designs on feedback and findings from  the user research.

#### Low-Fidelity Prototypes
Using the completed set of digital wireframes, I created a low-fidelity prototype. The primary user flow I connected was short listing a vendor from ‘bride’s wear’ category, so the prototype could be used in a usability study. I also added other user flows like browsing the checklist, shortlist and ideas section.

##### Low-Fidelity Prototyping

#### Usability Study Findings
**Connect Online Portals :** If one can connect online in this app and groups can be made with friends and family to directly share wishlist within the app itself.

### Refining The Design
People wanted to be able to share the wishlist/shortlist/favourites list with their friends and family groups online. This feature was not there before but haven been added after usability study.

#### High-Fidelity Mockups and Prototypes
Using the completed set of low-fidelity prototypes, I created a high-fidelity mockup and prototype.

#### Going Forward
#### Takeaways
**Impact:** The feedback I have gotten from the final prototype is positive. My second usability study showed that the design of this app meets the user’s needs.

**One quote from peer feedback:** *“That’s a pretty good design and flow.”*
#### What I learned
In designing this project, I learned that user research plays an invaluable role in the UX process. Based on the influence of the user interviews, peer reviews and usability studies, I was able to iterate a comprehensive and inclusive design.
