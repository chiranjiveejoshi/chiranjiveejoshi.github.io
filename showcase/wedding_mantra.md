Wedding Mantra is a ‘One-Stop-Shop’ App, designed to assist people who are unable to allocate enough time to plan a dream wedding for themselves or their loved ones. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as having a very demanding schedule or living far away. Wedding Mantra can help accomplish hassle-free online experience of vendor comparison, enabling users to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and fashion without physically visiting various shops, venues, or vendors.

> Project Duration: November 2022 to January 2023

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
### My Role
Lead UX Designer, UX Researcher
### My Responsibilities
**User Research, Competitive Audits, Ideation, Wireframing, Mockups and Prototyping (Lo-Fi + Hi-Fi):**
* To design a Ceremonial Checklist App for trendy wedding
* To conduct Interviews
* To conduct Usability Studies
* To Ideate and Design App Screens
* To Test the Designs
* To ensure that the Designs are Interactive and provide a good User Flow, User Journey and an User Experience
* To conduct Test and Research
* To re-iterate on Designs
### The Problem
Many people are unable to devote the necessary time and attention to plan a dream wedding, due to busy schedules, travel, or other commitments. Consequently, this leads to a lot of hassle, an inability to achieve an envisioned target  of having a dream wedding, and a lack of satisfaction.
### The Goal
The aim is to verify if users can effectively utilize the app's browsing features, shortlist vendors, finalize bookings, and add tasks to checklists to ensure everything is on track. By doing so, we can determine whether the app is helping users achieve their goal of having a dream wedding without missing out on current trends and fashion.
### Tools Used

## DESIGN PROCESS
I followed the ‘Design Thinking Framework’ for this project. The Design Thinking Framework is a user-centered approach to problem-solving that includes activities like Research, Prototyping and Testing to help understand who the ‘User’ is, what their problems are, and what the design should include.

## UNDERSTANDING THE USER
### User Research

### User Painpoints

### Persona
#### Persona 1 : Ms. Aarushi Gore

#### Persona 2 : Mr. Chinmay Shahane

### User Journey Map
I created a User Journey Map which is an illustration of what the user goes through to achieve their goals. It helped me understand user’s problems, experiences, moods and behaviour, while using a product.

### Story Boarding
I designed ‘Big Picture Storyboard’ and ‘Closeup Storyboard’ for one of my persona (Aarushi) to visually predict and understand her experience while using my app.

## COMPETITIVE AUDIT
I conducted a Competitive Analysis by comparing the different features and experience of browsing through different vendors of both, ‘Direct’ and ‘Indirect’ Competitors’ Apps with the aim of identifying whether the needs of users are met and common problems that I can solve with my app.

## START THE DESIGN
### Paper Wireframes
I proceeded to sketch Wireframes. 
I started with Paper Wireframes for the main interfaces that show a complete User Flow. The main goal in this stage was to create easy and quick iterations of the Design for a simple User Flow. 

Taking the time to draft iterations of each screen of the app on paper ensured that the elements that made it to Digital Wireframes would be well-suited to address User Pain Points.

### Digital Wireframes
As the initial Design phase continued, I made sure to base Screen Designs on Feedback and Findings from the User Research and created Digital Wireframes making sure all the app features are iterated.

### Low-Fidelity Prototypes
Using the completed set of Digital Wireframes, I created a ‘Low-Fidelity’ Prototype. The primary User Flow I connected was ‘Shortlisting’ a Vendor from ‘Bridal Wear’ category, so the Prototype could be used in the Usability Study.

## ACCESSIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS

## TAKEAWAYS
### Impact
The feedback I have gotten from the Final Prototype is Positive. My second Usability Study showed that the Design of this App meets the User’s needs.

**One quote from the peer feedback:**
> "That’s a pretty good design and flow."

### What I learned
In designing this project, I learned that User Research plays an invaluable role in the UX process. Based on the influence of the User Interviews, Peer Reviews and Usability Studies, I was able to iteratively improve my Design to become more comprehensive and inclusive.
